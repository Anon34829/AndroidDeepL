## Product flavors
The application contains two product flavors dimensions: "mode" and "service". With the "mode" dimension, you can build the app using the DeepL or the OpenL mode. This will only change the application name and icon. The "service" dimension allow you to build the application with or without the Google Play Services. This is mainly used to be able to provide a build to F-Droid.
